# OCR Markdown Converter

This Python tool converts scanned PDF documents into clean, structured Markdown (`.md`) files using OCR. It preserves the document's original layout as readable text, making it ideal for downstream processing like search indexing, NLP, or vector database embedding. The tool supports batch processing and is optimized for high-DPI OCR using Tesseract and Poppler.

Guideline Scope
Cardiac rhythm monitoring devices fall broadly into the following categories:
1.	Implantable recording devices â€” Devices implanted subcutaneously which continuously record and
transmit cardiac electrical activity. This device is also known as implantable loop recorder (ILR).
2.	Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry â€” External ambulatory monitoring devices capable of real-time
recording and automatic transmission of cardiac electrical activity. These devices are also known as
mobile outpatient cardiac telemetry or real-time remote heart monitors.
3.	Ambulatory event monitors â€” External devices which can record cardiac electrical activity for up to 30
days.
